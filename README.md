## RebelCon 2017

Cork is currently enjoying a huge expansion in its software industry. With global giants and local SME’s building world leading software products and blazing a trail in the tech sector, it seems unusual that there hasn’t been a dedicated software development conference so far. Well that’s all about to change as local tech giants Poppulo (formerly Newsweaver) and DesignWizard join forces with it@cork Skillnet to bring RebelCon Leeside.

RebelCon is a not for profit technology conference run by the developer community for the developer community. It’s happening on 16th June 2017 at the newly opened Republic of Work located on the South Mall.
It features a line up of national and international speakers with a wealth of software industry experience. Talks on the day will span the latest technology, cultural and development practices in the software industry.
